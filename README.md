📊 Instagram Analytics Dashboard
End-to-End Data Analysis & Visualization Project

📌 Overview

This project analyzes Instagram performance data to uncover meaningful insights related to engagement, reach, and content effectiveness.
It demonstrates a complete data analytics workflow, starting from raw data cleaning to SQL-based analysis and finally building an interactive Power BI dashboard.

The project is designed to showcase practical data analysis, visualization, and business insight generation skills using real-world style social media data.

🎯 Problem Statement

Social media platforms generate large volumes of data, but without proper analysis, it is difficult to understand:
What type of content performs best
How engagement varies across posts
Which metrics influence reach and interaction
This project aims to transform raw Instagram data into actionable insights that can help improve content strategy.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python – Pandas, NumPy (Data Cleaning & Analysis)
Jupyter Notebook – Exploratory Data Analysis
SQL – Structured querying and insights
Power BI – Interactive dashboard & visualization
CSV Files – Data storage and processing

🔍 Data Cleaning & Preparation

The raw dataset was cleaned using Python (Pandas):
Removed missing and inconsistent values
Standardized column formats
Prepared data for analysis and visualization
Exported a clean dataset for SQL and Power BI usage
This step ensures data accuracy and reliability before analysis.

📊 Analysis Performed

Using SQL and Python, the following analyses were conducted:
Engagement trends across posts
Performance comparison between different content types
Identification of high-performing posts
Patterns in reach and interaction metrics

📈 Power BI Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard provides:
Interactive visualizations for engagement and reach
Clear and structured layout
Easy exploration of Instagram performance data
Business-friendly presentation for decision-making
The dashboard helps users quickly understand what works and what doesn’t.

💡 Key Insights

Engagement varies significantly based on content type
Certain posts generate higher interaction rates
Data-driven insights can support better posting strategies
Visualization simplifies complex data for non-technical users
(Insights can be expanded further for marketing or business use cases.)
